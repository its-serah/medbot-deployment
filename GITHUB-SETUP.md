# GitHub Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Repository name: `medbot-deployment`
3. Description: `AI Medical Assistant - Production-ready Flask chatbot with Docker deployment`
4. Set to **Public** (required for free deployment on most platforms)
5. **Do NOT initialize with README** (we already have files)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Configure Git (if not already done)

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## Step 3: Push to GitHub

```bash
cd /home/serah/medbot-deployment

# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/medbot-deployment.git

# Rename branch to main (modern standard)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Verify Upload

Visit your GitHub repository URL: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/medbot-deployment`

You should see all the files including:
- README.md (clean, professional description)
- Dockerfile (production-ready container)
- All Python files and templates
- Deployment configurations for multiple platforms
