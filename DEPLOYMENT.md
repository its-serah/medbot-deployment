```

## Quick Deployment Instructions

### 1. Local Testing

```bash
# Clone/copy the project
cd medbot-deployment

# Test without Docker
python3 app.py
# Visit: http://localhost:8080

# Test with Docker
docker build -t medbot .
docker run -p 8080:8080 medbot
# Visit: http://localhost:8080
```

### 2. Docker Setup with Optimized Requirements

The project includes two requirements files:
- `requirements.txt` - Full GPU-enabled dependencies for development
- `requirements.docker.txt` - Optimized CPU-only dependencies for containerization

For quick Docker startup, use the provided script:
```bash
# Quick start (uses existing image or builds if needed)
./start-docker.sh

# Force rebuild
./start-docker.sh --build
```

### 3. Add Your Trained Model (Optional)

Place your fine-tuned model files in the `models/` directory:
```
models/
├── config.json
├── tokenizer.json
├── tokenizer_config.json
├── adapter_model.bin      # LoRA adapter
└── other_model_files...
```

The app will automatically detect and load your model. If no model is found, it uses intelligent fallback responses.

### 3. Deploy to Cloud Platform

#### Option A: Hugging Face Spaces
1. Create new Space: https://huggingface.co/spaces
2. Choose "Docker" SDK
3. Upload all files to repository
4. Space automatically deploys

#### Option B: Render
1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Create Web Service
3. Docker auto-detected
4. Deploy automatically

#### Option C: Railway
1. Connect repository to Railway
2. Dockerfile auto-detected
3. Deploy with one click

#### Option D: Fly.io
```bash
flyctl auth login
flyctl launch
flyctl deploy
```

## Model Integration Guide

### Using Your Fine-Tuned Model

1. **Export your trained model**:
   ```python
   # In your training notebook
   model.save_pretrained("./medbot_model")
   tokenizer.save_pretrained("./medbot_model")
   ```

2. **Copy to deployment**:
   ```bash
   cp -r ./medbot_model/* ./medbot-deployment/models/
   ```

3. **Update model configuration** (optional):
   Edit `model.py` to adjust generation parameters:
   - `max_new_tokens`: Response length
   - `temperature`: Creativity level
   - `top_p`: Response diversity

### Fallback System

The application includes a robust fallback system that:
- Automatically activates if model loading fails
- Provides medically accurate responses for common conditions
- Includes appropriate medical disclaimers
- Ensures the app never crashes due to model issues

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Requirements
- **RAM**: 2GB minimum (8GB+ recommended with large models)
- **CPU**: 2 cores minimum
- **GPU**: Optional but recommended for large models
- **Storage**: 1GB minimum (depends on model size)

### Optimization Tips
1. Use quantized models (4-bit/8-bit) for memory efficiency
2. Enable model caching for faster subsequent loads
3. Configure worker processes based on available resources
4. Use CDN for static assets in production

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
- Endpoint: `GET /health`
- Returns: JSON with status and model availability
- Use for uptime monitoring and deployment verification

### Logging
- Application logs to stdout (captured by container platforms)
- Structured logging with levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Model loading and inference logging included

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when model unavailable
- User-friendly error messages
- Medical disclaimer always included
- Emergency contact reminder in error cases

## Security Considerations

### Medical AI Compliance
- Clear medical disclaimers on all responses
- Emergency contact reminders
- No diagnostic claims or specific medical advice
- Educational purpose statements

### Application Security
- Non-root container execution
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting ready (add nginx/reverse proxy)
- HTTPS ready for production deployment

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Model not loading**: Check file paths and permissions
2. **Out of memory**: Use smaller model or increase container memory
3. **Slow responses**: Enable GPU or use quantized models
4. **Build failures**: Check Docker and system resources

### Getting Help
1. Check application logs in deployment platform
2. Verify model files are correctly formatted
3. Test locally with Docker before deploying
4. Review platform-specific deployment guides
