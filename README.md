## Quick Start

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/medbot-deployment.git
   cd medbot-deployment
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

### Docker Deployment

1. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t medbot .
   ```

2. **Run the container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 medbot
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   Visit `http://localhost:8080`

## Model Integration

### Using Your Fine-Tuned Model

1. **Export your trained model:**
   ```python
   model.save_pretrained("./medbot_model")
   tokenizer.save_pretrained("./medbot_model")
   ```

2. **Copy to deployment:**
   ```bash
   cp -r ./medbot_model/* ./models/
   ```

3. **The application will automatically detect and load your model**

### Fallback System

If no custom model is found, MedBot uses an intelligent fallback system that:
- Provides medically accurate responses for common conditions
- Includes appropriate medical disclaimers
- Ensures the app never crashes due to model issues
- Maintains professional medical assistant behavior

## Deployment Options

### Render.com (Recommended)
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Render
3. Auto-detects Docker configuration
4. Deploys with HTTPS automatically

### Railway.app
1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Auto-detects and deploys
3. Provides instant URL

### Fly.io
```bash
flyctl auth login
flyctl launch
flyctl deploy
```

### Heroku
1. Set stack to container: `heroku stack:set container`
2. Deploy: `git push heroku main`

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `PORT`: Application port (default: 8080)
- `FLASK_ENV`: Environment mode (production/development)
- `HOST`: Host address (default: 0.0.0.0)

### Health Monitoring
- Health check endpoint: `GET /health`
- Returns JSON with status and model availability

## Security Features

- Input validation and sanitization
- Medical disclaimers on all responses
- Emergency contact reminders
- Non-root container execution
- Environment-based secrets management
