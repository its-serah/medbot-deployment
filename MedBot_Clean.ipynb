    "In this project I implemented a T4-friendly MedBot pipeline that fine-tunes and serves a large causal LLM with PEFT/LoRA in 4-bit NF4 using bitsandbytes (compute in fp16), loads the tokenizer with a valid pad token, and saves adapters for reuse; at inference I reload the base model in 4-bit and attach the trained adapters via PeftModel.from_pretrained, then drive behavior with a compact system prompt and a minimal few-shot exemplar that enforce a five-section medical response style (summary, differentials, red flags, next steps, teach-back) while hard-capping total words and per-section words and trimming the final prompt string to keep context small; I accept a live user question via an input cell, rebuild the prompt, slice the encoded input to the last 32â64 tokens to bound activations, disable KV-cache, and generate either in a single pass with tight max_new_tokens or with a chunked loop (small ctx and step) to extend answers safely without running out of memory; after decoding I sanitize the text by stripping code fences, HTML, scripts, placeholder exam artifacts like \"Answer: B\", and any scaffolding tags, and I append a deterministic clinical resource link selected by a small RESOURCE_MAP through pick_resource(user_q) so references are reliable rather than hallucinated; overall the cells produce concise, structured medical guidance that stays within VRAM limits, preserves safety cues (red flags and escalation advice), and yields stable, readable outputs from a single T4 session."

    "#LIMITATIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup is constrained by the hardware and by the choices I made to make it run on a single T4: 4-bit NF4 quantization with fp16 compute reduces memory but also reduces numerical precision and can blunt reasoning, recall, and calibration; LoRA adapts only a small slice of the network (QKV in my case), so domain adaptation is shallow and may miss FFN-level semantics; training steps, batch size, and context are aggressively capped for VRAM, which limits convergence and generalization; the prompt is hard-capped in words and then sliced at tokenization time, so longer clinical narratives lose context and answers can become generic; disabling the KV cache and using chunked generation avoids OOM but breaks long-range coherence and can increase repetition, and the repetition and no-repeat constraints I applied can also suppress legitimate phrasing; the regex cleaner can strip useful structure or leave artifacts and it cannot guarantee removal of all unsafe or off-format text; the deterministic RESOURCE_MAP link is safer than model-generated URLs but it's coarse, non-exhaustive, English-centric, and not personalized to guidelines outside the NHS; there is no browsing or external grounding at inference, so the model can still hallucinate facts and dates even when the output looks clean; I did not run formal evaluation (held-out loss, human red-team, or benchmarked safety tests), so quality claims are observational; loading adapters from a fixed path assumes consistent versions of transformers/peft/bitsandbytes, and small version drifts can silently change behavior; finally, this is a medical-style assistant fine-tuned on public text without clinician labels or RLHF safety alignment, so it should not be treated as diagnostic advice and will remain brittle on rare presentations, comorbidities, non-English inputs, and edge cases."

    "Future work will focus on lifting quality, grounding, and deployability beyond the current 4-bit NF4 + LoRA(QKV) notebook flow with prompt caps and chunked generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, grow and clean the training set, then run longer supervised fine-tuning with early stopping, a held-out split, and small learning-rate sweeps; increase LoRA capacity (higher rank and selectively include FFN "dense" modules) and track gains with simple section-completeness and loss metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can add retrieval-augmented generation over a vetted mini-corpus of clinical guidelines so answers cite sources instead of relying on a static resource map. Harden safety by baking explicit refusal rules, automatic red-flag insertion checks, and a lightweight red-team set; evaluate hallucination and over-certainty before each release.\n",
    "\n",
    "For inference, we can replace the chunk loop with a sliding window that re-enables the key/value cache in small segments, test a distilled student model for lower latency, and keep a merged CPU fallback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can package the pipeline as a small API service with versioned adapters, request limits, structured logging, and basic monitoring, then A/B test prompts and decoding settings so every change (data, LoRA, RAG, prompt) proves measurable improvement before promotion."
